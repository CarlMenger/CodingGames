Scoring works as follows:
A zombie is worth the number of humans still alive squared x10, not including Ash.
If several zombies are destroyed during on the same round,
the nth zombie killed's worth is multiplied by the (n+2)th number of the Fibonnacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on).
 As a consequence, you should kill the maximum amount of zombies during a same turn.
